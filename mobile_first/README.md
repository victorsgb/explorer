👨‍💻 **Task:** To build a static web page of an ice cream online shop, based on [this Figma mobile layout](https://www.figma.com/file/drBBktNRdtCIUiN4cZk4yo/Stage-03---Mobile-First/duplicate) and its [desktop version](https://www.figma.com/file/pddZCuQIRLjk5dEHQ4L4YR/Stage-03---Grid-com-anima%C3%A7%C3%B5es/duplicate).

> 
> Reinforced the recent knowledge about CSS Grid by using it in different sections of the form. 
>
> Practiced CSS syntax related to transitions and animations as well.
