# 🚀 Rocketseat's Explorer Coursework

### Stage 08 | Challenge 12: Building an API from scratch

---

📅 **Aug 2nd, 2022**

⏳ **Status:** Finished ✔️

👨‍💻 **Task:** To build my first API from scratch, using the active recall method to exercise what I have been taught about the subject. I had to build the routes and database following [this document](https://efficient-sloth-d85.notion.site/Aplica-o-em-Node-57bd49ae77b3422fad74f8dde0d06fef).

> This project was an opportunity to reinforce my recent knowledge of Node.js. 
>
> Insomnia was used to build and test the HTTP routes
>
> Beekeeper Studio was used to view records in database
>
> Knex was used to migrate the creation of SQL tables
>
> SQLite3 was used to connect with the database 
>
> Depedencies in production:
>
>>    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
>>    "express": "^4.18.1",
>>    "express-async-errors": "^3.1.1",
>>    "knex": "^2.2.0",
>>    "sqlite3": "^5.0.11" 
>
> Depedencies in development:
>
>>    "nodemon": "^2.0.19"

**How to run this API**
> Start by cloning the repository into your machine. Then execute:
>> npm install
> 
> which will install npm and the depedencies of this project. After that, execute:
>> npm run migrate
> 
> which will create all SQL tables required by the API. Finally, execute:
>> npm start
>
> which should initialize the server.
