👨‍💻 **Task:** Create a static website with a flexible layout that adheres to any kind of device (focusing on mobile and desktop users). A [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/DDFFO0Wh6wpOa0LdwNuR0y/Explorer-Stage-03-Projeto-02/duplicate) containing two layouts - one for each of both displays mentioned - has been provided for such practice.

>
> Practiced the inspection of a given Figma project containing two layouts (mobile and desktop), to plan ahead how to structure and create its corresponding responsive web page.
>
> Practiced CSS syntax to turn the layout responsive (using the at-rule @media).
