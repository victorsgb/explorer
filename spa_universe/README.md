👨‍💻 **Task:** To create a simple SPA, based on  [this Figma layout](https://www.figma.com/file/m8zp3mtxvwyTGQs69nIFM8/%5BDesafios-Explorer%5D-SPA-Universe/duplicate) using the big trio of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

> This small project was an opportunity to reinforce the recent knowledge acquired regarding routes and JS classes.
>
> index.html was responsible for structuring the static HTML elements, i.e., the page general layout, as well as defining where the other elements show up, when appropriate (contained within the tag identified as #id)
>
> style.css was responsible for styling the page
>
> index.js was responsible for importing the Router class from router.js, as well as creating its instance and adding appropriate routes to it
>
> and router.js contained the scripts where all the 'magic' happens.

🌱 **Stacks:** HTML | CSS | JavaScript
