### ðŸ’¡ Highlights
This Stage introduced me to HTML and CSS, the technologies most used in Front-end development. I learned about inspecting Figma layouts to build their web page versions. I also learned the basics of HTML syntax and semantics and CSS for styling HTML elements in terms of positioning and alignment, font customization, and more.
