📅 **Aug 22th, 2022**

⏳ **Status:** Finished ✔️

👨‍💻 **Task:** To build my first frontend web using React, with the active recall technique to exercise what I have been taught about the subject. I had to build it according to [this Figma layout](https://www.figma.com/file/UObYagRzmvi5PY4HhmzEHM/RocketMovies/duplicate).

> This project was an opportunity to reinforce my recent knowledge of React 
>
> Vitejs was used to deploy the React project
>
> Depedencies in production:
>

>>    "react": "^18.2.0",
>>    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
>>    "react-icons": "^4.4.0",
>>    "react-router-dom": "^6.3.0",
