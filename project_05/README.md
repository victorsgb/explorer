👨‍💻 **Task:** Learn CSS Grid by doing a small static website that adheres to any kind of device (focusing on mobile and desktop users).

> Reinforced the recent knowledge about responsivity as a whole and how the mobile-first paradigm facilitates the development of responsive websites. 
>
> Practiced the inspection of a given Figma project containing two layouts (mobile and desktop), to plan ahead how to structure and create its corresponding responsive web page.
>
> Practiced CSS syntax to turn the layout responsive (using the at-rule @media).
>
> Practiced CSS syntax related to transitions and animations (the latter using the at-rule @keyframes).

### 💡 Highlights

This is my first project using animations and transitions, they are indeed fun to play with!
