>
> Practiced HTML and CSS syntax to build a form that gets user input.
>

>
> Learned about what to take care of in terms of acessibility, to allow users to fill in the form via keyboard input solely.
>
> Learned about where to check for contrast issues using the DevTools.
>
> Further solidified HTML (specially the form, fieldset, and input tags) and CSS skills (specially pseudo-classes) to build a web page.
