👨‍💻 **Task:** Actively recall from memory all concepts learned so far to develop another Focus timer, now based on [this Figma layout](https://www.figma.com/file/nlJJAVuGDc1tnDKqUW4FJA/Stage-05---Dark-Mode-FocusTimer/duplicate) using the big trio of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

> index.html was responsible for structuring the page layout
>
> style.css was responsible for styling the page
>
> index.js was responsible for joining together the other js files, listed below:
>
> > elements.js was responsible for capturing all relevant HTML elements, which were used by the other js files
> 
> > timer.js was responsible for the logic of the timer, with functionalities of play, pause, stop, and 
> increment/decrement minutes
> 
> > sounds.js was responsible for importing all audio files used in the application
> 
> > controls.js was responsible for capturing user input to trigger the timer functionalities 
> via its controls, but also for adjusting the audio volumes and toggling between light and dark modes

> I focused on using ES6 modules, the Factory Pattern and Depedency Injection.
